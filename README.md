##### Used 5 tables #####
##### Broke the movie theater expirence into 5 tables of Customer, Tickets, Movie, Concessions, and the total transcation or purchase #####
##### All tables funnel to purchase #####
##### Customer ID is shown the most in Customer table, Ticket Table, Concession Table, and Purchase table as obviously a customer will be buying a ticket and MIGHT buy at the concessions #####
##### I think this was was the simplest to keep organized #####
